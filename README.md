## QIIME2 Analysis Data
The `16S` and `ITS` repositories contain the BASH scripts used to run QIIME2 steps, 
including relevant parameters for demultiplexing, denoising, clustering, phylogeny
building, and diversity analyses. Also included are .tsv files of the clustering feature
tables, and Newick phylogenies.

`EnvironmentalAnalyses` includes the .csv files containing environmental data relevant to 
the RHF fieldsites, as well as an R script (`AspectAnalysis.R`) that pulls all of these 
together into straightforward correlations.
